pcaps
=====

Public Repository of all Publicly Available Packet Captures that I've used or come across :) 

They're all free and open to the public so I don't think I'm violating any licnese and to be clear, they're not my creation! I just put them up here so I could download them via "git clone" and so others can easily download pcaps for workshops etc.

My own pcaps from HackEire can be found at https://github.com/markofu/hackeire/tree/master/2010/pcap and https://github.com/markofu/hackeire/tree/master/2011/pcap.
