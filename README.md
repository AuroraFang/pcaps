PCAPS
=====

Public Repository of all Publicly Available Packet Captures that I've used or come across :) 

They're all free and open to the public so I don't think I'm violating any licnese and to be clear, they are *not* my creation! I just put them up here so I could download them via "git clone" and so others can easily download pcaps for workshops etc.

My own pcaps from HackEire can be found at https://github.com/markofu/hackeire/tree/master/2010/pcap and https://github.com/markofu/hackeire/tree/master/2011/pcap.

HOW
===

- *git clone git://github.com/markofu/pcaps.git* [the *pcaps* repo will be around 1.1gb btw]

- Play around with *tcpdump*, *tshark*, *Wireshark* or mabye use *tcpreplay* to replay a pcap through a NSM solution like Security Onion, who knows :)

TO DO
=====

- Free up some local disk space so I can add more pcaps to the repo :)
